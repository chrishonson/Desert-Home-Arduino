Desert Home Arduino Code

This is the companion to my Desert-Home-RPi repository.  This is the Arduino code for the various devices I have
scattered around the house.  Note, that this is the actual code I use, so it may not be exactly what you want, just
fork off a copy of it and change what you need for your own purposes.

I also have test and example code here that post on my blog from time to time

Visit desert-home.com for documentation and descriptions of the various items.
